# A3C Breakout

This is an advanced AI made to play the game Breakout! The AI uses A3C, Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic, a very powerful reinforcement learning program. 

## The AI
In terms of the gameplay, it learns the direction of the ball, and what it has to do to stay alive and receive rewards. It has 4 layers, an LSTM layer, an actor and critic layer. It learns by watching the direction of the ball, then deciding whether to move left or right. The code outputs videos of the AI playing, so the user can witness the progression. 


## Prerequisites

This project uses Python 2. You will need PyTorch, Numpy, Matplotlib, openAI gym, and so on. I used Spyder on Anaconda to code this. Just fork the repo, download and play!
